### Project Description
🎮 Cherry Slicer - A Useless Project Full of Juice & Joy 🍒🔪
Ever wanted to slice cherries just for fun? No? Well, too bad - we made it anyway.
Introducing Cherry Slicer, the world's most unnecessarily adorable fruit-slicing game no one asked for… but everyone ends up loving!

🖌 Made with ✨ Passion & IbisPaint
We didn’t just use any cherries and knives - we drew them, pixel by pixel in IbisPaint X.
From the sassy cherries with cheeky faces to the cutest little knife you've ever seen, everything was hand-drawn with love and chaos in mind 🍒💅

💻 Built in VS Code (a.k.a our battlefield)
With some spicy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we brought the cherry carnage to life.
The cherries bounce, the knife follows your cursor, and when you click - oh boy - juicy slicing action begins.

🔁 Features We’re Weirdly Proud Of:
🍒 Randomly bouncing cherries that do absolutely nothing but look cute and run away.

🔪 A knife that follows your mouse like a loyal samurai.

🎯 A slicing mechanism that makes you feel like a fruit ninja… on vacation.

🧃 A score counter — because apparently we needed a reason to justify this game.

🖱 A Start Over button so you can keep slicing till you forget why you even started.

🚫 Productivity? Never Heard of Her.
This project is beautifully useless, and that's the point.
We made it not to solve a real-world problem, but to laugh, learn, and make something ridiculously fun — because not everything has to be serious to be valuable 💅

Made with ❤ by Team Null & Void
Because sometimes, slicing fruit is all the therapy you need 🍒💻✨
